My name is Andy Wohlgenant, and I currently do freelance geoscience and analytics consulting. I'm also pursuing a [Master's degree in Data Analytics](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/graduate/data-analytics/) from the Statistics Department at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/).

In my career as a geoscientist, I worked for about 20 years as a geologist and geophysicist in the oil and gas industry for organizations ranging from ExxonMobil to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and, most recently, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., a worldwide petroleum consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, USA.

I live in the San Francisco Bay area in California.
