My name is Andy Wohlgenant and I am a graduate student studying Data Analytics at Oregon State University.

Prior to my studies at Oregon State, I worked for 19 years as a geologist and geophysicist in the oil and gas industry for ExxonMobil, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Halliburton, and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc., a worldwide petroleum consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, USA.

I currently reside in the San Francisco Bay area in California.
